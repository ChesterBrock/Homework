How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

	Before I made edits to the program I was getting few to non under 20.. test case two being the most because it seems to have checked every single case. After the edited I am getting under 20 case cases in each. 


What is good or bad about this strategy?
	
	With random. Its all about luck and you never know whats going come out the other side. I'm guessing thats a bad thing unless your guess actually turns out better than the forced method.
